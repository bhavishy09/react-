React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. You can use it maximally as a React framework or as minimally as you want.



router gives you 
import {link , navlink } form react router dom
link--> for 'a=> for page reload ' tag-->but 
in react there is no concept of reload value jati h and dom se direct inject ho jati h

--> thats why we use link tag becuse 'a' tab m page reload hota  h 

navlink--> give additional features-->use call back for css clasess
clasname{()=> 
    `     `
}

we use isActive --> which give you on which page you in current time suppose on home then home tab is highlighted
